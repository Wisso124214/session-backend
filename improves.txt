  - When the session is creating, it must use the device_id to does not confuse session between devices
  - Si hay un error interno, rara vez llega al cliente
  - On /create-session route (userRoutes) check if the device and user have an session, if isn't create it, else, only /set-session
  - The id_session must be found searching the match with id_user and id_device, not be in user register

  - If an user goes first to an page without login, the frontend must 
   send information to an endpoint ('/info-user'?) and save it in an object
   on backend with the username as key. When the info-user is getted by 
   another route run an setTimeout to filter and delete the info of the user
   5000 ms I think is ok. (The same logic to the jwt)

   - On config create an object of specific code errors, and use it correctly

   - If any table or register is corrupted or missing, create it with the default values
